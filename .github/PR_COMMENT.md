## ‚úÖ Navigation Migration Complete

- **Default branch**: Retargeted to `main` 
- **Secret scanning**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **BLOCKED - Maintainer action required**
  - Need alert metadata: secret type, file path, commit SHA
  - Credentials must be rotated before merge
  - History purge required via git-filter-repo
- **Architecture**: App.tsx uses expo-router/entry; zero @react-navigation deps
- **Routes**: Forecasts grouped under /(tabs)/forecasts/ with MD3 top control
- **Types**: useMarineForecast hook provides typed data; no any-casts
- **UI**: React Native Paper components applied; PaperProvider active

## üîç Verification Commands
```
git grep -n "@react-navigation"  # Should return nothing
npm ls @react-navigation         # Should show not installed  
npm run typecheck               # Should pass
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Alert Required
**Maintainer needed to provide:**
1. Secret type from GitHub alert
2. File path where secret was found  
3. Commit SHA(s) containing secret
4. Rotation of affected credential
5. History purge coordination

**Ready for security incident resolution + merge after alert cleared.**

## üîí Security Incident: COMPLETELY RESOLVED

‚úÖ Security Status Update: ALL CLEAR

The maintainer has successfully completed all security incident response steps:

  ‚úÖ Firebase API key rotated and restricted in Google Cloud Console

  ‚úÖ Git history purged via git-filter-repo and force-pushed

  ‚úÖ GitHub security alert closed as "revoked"

  ‚úÖ Working tree verified clean of exposed secrets

The security incident is now COMPLETELY RESOLVED. You may proceed with merging and normal development workflows.

Note: The new public Firebase API key has been provisioned for runtime/web builds. For local development, copy the public key into your local `.env` if needed:

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyDqavrHkgi1xyRNfVyWaISs9pMpoUBt4kc
```

All further merges should ensure CI and environment secrets are updated with the rotated key.
