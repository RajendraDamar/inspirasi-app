Adds a complete Settings UI and backend wiring for user preferences.

What this PR includes:
- Firestore-backed user_preferences service with real-time subscription and AsyncStorage fallback
- useUserPreferences React Query hook for caching and mutation
- SettingsContext to provide preferences and save helper
- app/settings.tsx UI providing language, notification preferences, theme, data & location settings, and security controls

Why:
- Enables per-user preferences persisted to the Firebase emulator and usable offline

How to test:
1. Start Firebase emulators (firestore at :8200)
2. Start the app (expo web) and navigate to /settings
3. Sign in or ensure a test user exists; edit preferences and click Save. Verify Firestore emulator shows data under user_preferences/<uid> and UI updates.

Notes:
- Type-safe implementation with TypeScript and React Query
- Uses project patterns for guarded react-native-paper imports
