This PR contains a set of low-risk, instruction-driven improvements:

- Add src/constants/locationCodes.ts for BMKG location codes
- Add .env.example documenting required environment variables
- Update src/services/firebase/config.ts to read config from environment and expose IS_FIREBASE_CONFIGURED and ensureFirebaseConfigured()
- Enable strict TypeScript (tsconfig.json) and set JSX to react-jsx
- Add an "Environment" section to README.md

Audit note: An npm audit still reports a small set of vulnerabilities (1 moderate, 5 high). The undici advisory is transitive (coming from CLI tooling expo -> @expo/cli -> undici). I recommend a separate PR to safely upgrade the Expo CLI / toolchain and reconcile lockfiles.
